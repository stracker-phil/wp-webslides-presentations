Create professional presentations direct inside WordPress. Not a subscription or external service!

== Description ==
Leverage the power of the free Webslides framework to create your own presentations directly in WordPress block editor (Gutenberg).

*Works with every theme*

Your presentations are saved in a custom post type and displayed with a special HTML template, that loads the Webslides CSS and JS library. No matter what theme you use, the presentations will always look and feel the same everywhere.

*Slide elements*

We work to frequently add new modules to give you more power when creating new presentations. At the moment a presentation can include the following elements:

* Slides
* 1-5 Columns
* Headlines
* Paragraphs

*Notes*
